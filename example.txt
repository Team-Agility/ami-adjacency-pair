After having installed NLTK and scikit-learn, you can import the script:

>>> import amitools
>>> c = amitools.getCorpus(observations=['ES2002a.csv'],root="")['ES2002a.csv']

getCorpus takes a root directory and a list of files. By default, it searches for the directory "csv/" and opens every file therein.

In this example we open the file ES2002a.csv in the current working directory.

Maybe we are interested in the turn around the 270ths utterance in the corpus:

>>> amitools.findTurn(c,270)
(269, 273, 4)

This says that the turn starts at index 269, that the first utterance of the following turn is at index 273, and that the turn has length 4.

We can print out a range of utterances:

>>> amitools.prettyPrint(c,269,273)
269 - bck D: Yep .
270 POS ass D: Yeah ,
271 POS inf D: I'd say so ,
272 POS ass D: yeah .

The presence of POS indicates that 270, 271 and 272 are utterances that form second-parts of an adjacency pair indicating agreement. We can find the first-parts:

>>> amitools.findTarget(c,270)
268
>>> amitools.findTarget(c,271)
268
>>> amitools.findTarget(c,272)
268

In this case, all three utterances have the same first-pair. We can find the turn it belongs to:

>>> amitools.findTurn(c,268)
(260, 269, 7)
>>> amitools.prettyPrint(c,260,269)
260 POS ass B: Yeah , yeah .
261 UNC el.inf B: Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .
262 - bck D: Uh-huh .
263 - inf B: Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something ,
264 - el.inf B: isn't it ?
265 - bck D: Mm-hmm .
266 UNC ass B: Or no ,
267 - el.inf B: is it as much as that ?
268 - inf B: Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .

Thus, the utterances 270, 271, 272 agree with "Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds".
